# TOGAF Enterprise AI-Powered Fault Diagnosis & Knowledge Intelligence Platform
> Forensic image fault classification • vector similarity search • LLM-RAG engineering knowledge retrieval • GPU inference • EKS MLOps

---

## Executive Summary

This architecture defines an AI-driven fault-diagnostics platform for manufacturing and field-engineering support. It automates:

- Defect recognition from customer-returned product images

- Similarity search using FAISS vector databases

- Predictive fault classification (VGG16/CNN → future ViT upgrade)

- Technical knowledge retrieval using internal PDF reports (RAG)

- GPU-accelerated inference via Triton & FastAPI

- Scalable deployment on AWS EKS GPU clusters
